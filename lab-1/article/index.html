            <h2>The Rise of AI in Web Development</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is reshaping how developers build and interact with web applications. From AI-powered code completion to automated testing, the integration of AI technologies is streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity.</p>
            <p>Tools like GitHub Copilot and AI-driven design platforms are becoming standard in many development workflows, allowing developers to focus on creative problem-solving rather than repetitive coding tasks.</p>

            <h2>Serverless Architecture Continues to Grow</h2>
            <p>Serverless computing has moved beyond the early adoption phase and is now a mainstream approach for building scalable applications. The promise of reduced operational costs and automatic scaling continues to attract developers and organizations.</p>
            <p>Major cloud providers have expanded their serverless offerings, making it easier to deploy complex applications without managing infrastructure. This trend is particularly beneficial for startups and businesses looking to minimize DevOps overhead.</p>

        <section id="section3">
            <h2>WebAssembly Revolution</h2>
            <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is expanding beyond its initial use cases and finding applications in diverse domains. Originally designed to enable high-performance applications in browsers, Wasm is now being utilized for server-side applications, plugins, and even IoT devices.</p>
            <p>The cross-platform compatibility and security features of WebAssembly make it an attractive option for developers looking to write once and run anywhere, without sacrificing performance.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="section4">
            <h2>Accessibility as a Priority</h2>
            <p>Web accessibility has moved from being an afterthought to a fundamental consideration in web development. With increasing legal requirements and a growing awareness of inclusive design, developers are prioritizing accessibility from the start of projects.</p>
            <p>Modern frameworks and tools now incorporate accessibility features by default, making it easier for developers to create inclusive web experiences that work for everyone, regardless of abilities or disabilities.</p>
